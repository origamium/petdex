# petdex-desktop-native

Petdex on Native SDK (vercel-labs/native): no WebView, no Node sidecar.
Rewrite slice 1; strategy: upstream-first on latest Native SDK, no maintained fork.

## V1 (this package)

Runtime-loaded pet animating its real atlas in a chromeless window:
- Scans `~/.petdex/pets` + `~/.codex/pets` (`PETDEX_PET=<dir>` overrides).
- Canonical state table ported from the WebView renderer (9 states,
  per-frame durations, idle's irregular blink timing).
- App-side atlas decode (registry caps one image at 1MB pixels and the
  platform decode scratch at 1.25MB, so full sheets can't ride
  `registerImageBytes`): V1 uses a macOS dev shim (`sips` -> TGA -> Zig
  TGA parser); V5 replaces it with vendored libwebp on all platforms.
- Frames registered per state into slots 1..8, replaced in place.
- Space or `native automate native-command petdex.cycle` cycles states.

## Build & run

```bash
native build -Dautomation -Dtrace=off
PETDEX_PET=boba ./zig-out/bin/petdex-desktop-native
native automate screenshot pet-canvas
```

Without `-Dtrace=off` the SDK appends a trace record per frame and timer to
`native-sdk.jsonl` in the platform log directory (#714). Drop the flag only
while debugging; the app deletes that file once it passes 32 MB.

Requires the `@native-sdk/cli` global (`bun add -g @native-sdk/cli`).

For the pinned desktop build, set `NATIVE_CLI` and `NATIVE_SDK_PATH` to the
CLI and SDK checkout used by the matching release workflow. The build scripts
apply the Petdex-owned macOS Mach-O headerpad patch before compiling; they
fail if the SDK source no longer matches the pinned patch.

## Herdr

The local Herdr plugin mirrors agent attention from Herdr into Petdex and
preserves the exact pane ID so clicking the pet can focus that pane. Direct
Petdex hooks remain preferred for supported agents. See
[`integrations/herdr`](integrations/herdr/README.md) for setup and filtering.

## DeepSeek Harness (macOS)

The bundled DeepSeek Harness plugin mirrors official DSH Web session events
into Petdex. Install it from Settings, restart DSH Web, then start or continue
a task; Petdex reports the integration as connected only after receiving a real
event. One top-level DSH session becomes one task card, while subagents,
workflows, goals, and compaction update their parent card.

Clicking the pet activates the currently running default browser without
navigating to a URL or opening a tab. See
[`integrations/dsh`](integrations/dsh/README.md) for setup, behavior, and
troubleshooting.

## Remote agents (SSH)

Agents running on other machines can drive the same pet. Declare remotes in
`~/.petdex/remote-agents.json`:

```json
{
  "remotes": [
    {
      "name": "rogue",
      "host": "shakib@rogue.lan",
      "port": 22,
      "identity_file": "~/.ssh/id_ed25519",
      "enabled": true,
      "agents": {
        "opencode": { "enabled": true },
        "codex": { "enabled": false },
        "hermes": { "enabled": true, "home": "~/.hermes" }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

At launch the desktop probes each enabled remote (`ssh` with `BatchMode=yes`,
no password prompts ever), then runs a fetch-merge-writeback: the remote's
existing hook configs are read, merged locally by the exact installers a local
connect uses, and written back. Foreign hooks are preserved, never clobbered.
The desktop first verifies a supervised reverse tunnel
(`ssh -R 127.0.0.1:7777:127.0.0.1:7777`), installs executable dependencies
before the configs that enable them, starts the session reconcilers, and only
then atomically publishes the hook-server update token. Hook POSTs from the
remote can reach the desktop's loopback server only after that complete gated
patch pass succeeds.

Remote shell-exec agents (codex, hermes) invoke `~/.petdex/bin/petdex-hook` on
the remote, where a small POSIX sh + curl script (`src/assets/petdex-remote-hook.sh`)
mirrors the desktop hook runner's contract: stdin drain, killswitch
(`~/.petdex/runtime/hooks-disabled`), token-gated POSTs to `127.0.0.1:7777`,
never fails outward. The opencode plugin POSTs directly and works unchanged.

Notes:
- SSH only; there is no API fallback transport. Windows remotes are out of scope.
- Remote accounts need a POSIX shell and `ps`; Codex/Hermes reconciliation
  additionally needs `python3`, and their shell hooks need `curl`. Startup
  stays gated and reports a retrying state when a required dependency is absent.
- Names are `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,32}`, must be unique ignoring case, and appear
  in logs and private staging paths.
- `agents.hermes.home` is optional. Set it to Hermes's remote `HERMES_HOME`
  when that installation does not use `~/.hermes`; it must be absolute or
  begin with `~/`.
- Sync runs after every tunnel establishment, before that tunnel's feed token
  becomes available; the Settings "Remote Agents" section reports live status
  and stays read-only.
- If a remote account also runs a petdex desktop, do not point a remote at it:
  the writeback replaces that account's `~/.petdex/bin/petdex-hook` with the
  sh script.
